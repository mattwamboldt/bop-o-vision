Web based Audio Visualizer experiments

This repo is for experimenting with the Web Audio API to create slick visualizations like in old school audio players. As it expands to include different samples I'm sure the readme will get cooler. A goal of mine is to make something as cool or cooler than [this test project](https://vimeo.com/137999365?fbclid=IwAR39F__t4OoYqLK8joHCxHT8a6X-JVbVo9LXIOZ_TiTytAcXOS97zQdV-pM) a friend of mine made a couple years ago.

The test tracks are from Incompetech, a classic source for all yourtuber backing tracks.

## References
There aren't many good examples of programming visualizers so I've had to piece things together:

- [Mozilla Developer Site: Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) (Awesome resource in general)
- [Web Audio Api by Boris Smus](https://webaudioapi.com/book/)
- [The Coding Train's series on Sound.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn1g1wjxl_0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFcVjlDAkkGIixw70s7jpW) (Based on P5 but it's loose wrapper over the Web Audio API so the concepts apply. Actually visualizes a bit at the end.)
